# hello-world
First repository, where I start my journey on GitHub
Hello World!
This is me creating a GitHub account and getting in touch with the broad world of programming. I'm studying physics, so programming is one of the essential tools I require for my further career development. In other words, I want to learn to code to not suck.
Also, I'm a drummer on the side.
That's it about me!
